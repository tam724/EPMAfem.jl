# Literate is a package for [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).
# The main purpose is to facilitate writing Julia examples/tutorials that can be included in
# your package documentation.

# Literate can generate markdown pages
# (for e.g. [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl)), and
# [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/), from the same source file. There is also
# an option to "clean" the source from all metadata, and produce a pure Julia script.
# Using a single source file for multiple purposes reduces maintenance, and makes sure
# your different output formats are synced with each other.
#
# This README was generated directly from
# [this source file](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl/blob/master/examples/README.jl)
# running these commands from the package root of Literate.jl:
# Now comes my text!

# ```math 
# f(x) = \Omega * x
# ```

using Literate
Literate.markdown("examples/README.jl", "."; flavor = Literate.CommonMarkFlavor())
